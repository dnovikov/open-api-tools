# Open API Tools

## Motivation

Some tools like AWS API gateway generate unsorted OpenAPI specifications.
It brings some troubles in presenting documentation to customers despite might
be looking totally fine at the development/tooling side.

## Suggested solution

This is a very simplistic script used to sort OpenAPI 3 endpoints and tags
consistently.

## 3rd-party libraries used
